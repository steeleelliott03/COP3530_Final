## Final Project Proposal: Keep Your Eye on the Crime

### Problem Statement
Our goal is to identify Chicago districts with high crime rates, analyze prevalent crime types in these areas, and determine the months with the highest crime incidence.

### Motivation
Understanding crime patterns is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies. By focusing on specific districts and time frames, we can efficiently allocate resources to combat heightened crime rates.

### Features
The application successfully computes crime rates for distinct districts and dates, identifying vulnerable areas to specific crime types. Key features include:
- Hash Table and B+Tree for efficient data management.
- TKinter-based user interface for interaction with data structures.
- Data search capability based on date and crime type.
- Performance tracking for search and sorting operations.

### Data Source
- [Chicago Crime Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chicago/chicago-crime/data)

#### Data Description
The dataset includes reported Chicago crimes from 2001 up to the current date minus the last seven days. It originates from the CLEAR system of the Chicago Police Department. Data presented at the block level maintains victim privacy. The records contain preliminary data subject to revision and should not be used for long-term analysis. Our focus is on the year 2017.

### Tools
- Python
- GitHub
- Kaggle
- Google BigQueryAPI
- TKinter for UI development

### Algorithms Implemented
Our approach integrates advanced data structures, a Hash Table, and a B+ Tree, with TKinter for the user interface. This combination ensures rapid access to and analysis of crime data.

### Distribution of Responsibilities
- **Austin Markus**: Implementation of the Hash Table.
- **Steele Elliott**: Development of the B+ Tree structure.
- **Nadzumie Flores**: Creation of the TKinter-based user interface.
